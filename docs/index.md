## What is the Balena Fin?

The Balena Fin has been designed with field and industrial deployment in mind. It is a carrier board for the Raspberry Compute Module 3 Lite (CM3L), that can run all the software that the Raspberry Pi can run, hardened for field deployment use cases.

#### Raspberry Pi Compute Module

The Balena Fin supports the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 lite (CM3L).

#### Storage

The storage on the Balena Fin is based on an industrial grade eMMC card with 8GB, 16GB, 32GB and 64GB options available.

#### Power

The Balena Fin features a wide input power range (6V-24V), especially suitable for industrial applications where a reliable 5V is usually not available.

#### Co-processor

The Balena Fin includes a low-power co-processor (32-bit ARMÂ® Cortex M4) with Bluetooth support. The co-processor can run on its own or in parallel and allows the main processor to be powered on and off programmatically. This is especially useful in applications where low power consumption or real-time processing is required.

#### Connectivity

The Fin's wireless chip supports 802.11ac/a/b/g/n WiFI and Bluetooth 4.2 (including SMART features).
There is a dual-band embedded antenna included in the board and an external antenna connector for improved signal coverage.

#### I/O

The Mini PCI express port on the Fin expands the connectivity capabilities to a number of different modules (4G LTE, Zigbee, LoRa, additional storage, RS232/485, CANbus).
