# FAQ

## Do I have to use the Balena Fin with resin.io, and vice versa?

No! Any recent OS distribution (2018+) for the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B should be compatible with the Balena Fin. This includes Raspbian and resinOS 2.x targeting the “Balena Fin” device-type.

## What do I need to get up and running?

The minimum requirements to be able to run the Balena Fin are a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 Lite (CM3L) and a 6-24V PSU. These are included in the Fin Developer Kit, as seen [here](https://store.resin.io/collections/developer-kit).

## Can I use any Compute Module?

The Balena Fin supports the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 lite​ (CM3L). “Lite” means that the module itself has the eMMC socket unpopulated and the traces are exposed via SODIMM-200. This is important since non-Lite versions will not work with the Fin’s on-board storage.

## The Balena Fin doesn’t quite work for my use case. Do you offer customizations?

We offer the possibility to depopulate the board of certain components that don’t fit for a particular use case, given a minimum order quantity. We don't currently have the ability to take custom hardware modifications or to add components. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:fin@resin.io">fin@resin.io</a> to learn more.

## How long will the Balena Fin be supported?

The availability of the Balena Fin is guaranteed until January 2023.
